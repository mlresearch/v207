title: Will the sun shine? - An accessible dataset for teaching machine learning and
  deep learning
abstract: Hands-on teaching of modern machine learning and deep learning techniques
  heavily relies on the use of well-suited datasets. We present a novel tabular dataset
  that was specifically created for teaching machine learning and deep learning to
  an academic audience. The dataset contains intuitively accessible weather observations
  from 18 locations in Europe. It was designed to be suitable for a large variety
  of different training goals, and to avoid reaching unrealistically high prediction
  accuracy. Teachers or instructors thus can choose the difficulty of the training
  goals and thereby match it with the respective learner audience or lesson objective.
