title: Data, Trees, and Forests - Decision Tree Learning in K-12 Education
abstract: As a consequence of the increasing influence of machine learning on our
  lives, everyone needs competencies to understand corresponding phenomena, but also
  to get involved in shaping our world and making informed decisions regarding the
  influences on our society. Therefore, in K-12 education, students need to learn
  about core ideas and principles of machine learning. However, for this target group,
  achieving all of the aforementioned goals presents an enormous challenge. To this
  end, we present a teaching concept that combines a playful and accessible unplugged
  approach focusing on conceptual understanding with empowering students to actively
  apply machine learning methods and reflect their influence on society, building
  upon decision tree learning.
