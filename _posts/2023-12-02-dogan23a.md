title: Teaching Machine Learning with Applied Interdisciplinary Real World Projects
abstract: One of the challenges in teaching machine learning to computer science students
  consists in finding the right hands-on projects that students can work on. Most
  of the popular Machine Learning projects such as Titanic Survival Prediction and
  Housing Prices Prediction have many solutions available online. Students working
  on these problems do not get challenged enough to improve their experimental skills.
  Moreover, they might follow the methodology in the existing solutions which can
  discourage them from designing a novel ML solution. Real-world applied projects
  without online solutions in which students can use their creative problem-solving
  skills are needed to teach ML courses effectively. Otherwise, students fall into
  an overfitting problem in which they become ML coders reusing existing codes without
  ever writing their code. Consequently, we present an approach for creating course
  project material to achieve this goal. This approach is supported as an applied
  learning curriculum design methodology with an internal grant at our institution.
  It is validated experimentally for two semesters in a course taught to both graduate
  and undergraduate computer science students.
