title: 'Hearts Gym: Learning Reinforcement Learning as a Team Event'
abstract: Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the authors of this paper organized a Reinforcement
  Learning (RL) course for a graduate school in the field of data science. We describe
  the strategy and materials for creating an exciting learning experience despite
  the ubiquitous Zoom fatigue and evaluate the course qualitatively. The key organizational
  features are a focus on a competitive hands-on setting in teams supported by a minimum
  of lectures providing the essential background on RL. The practical part of the
  course revolved around Hearts Gym, an RL environment for the card game Hearts that
  we developed as an entry-level tutorial to RL. Participants were tasked with training
  agents to explore reward shaping and other RL hyperparameters. For a final evaluation,
  the agents of the participants competed against each other.
