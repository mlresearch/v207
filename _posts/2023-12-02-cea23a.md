title: 'Introduction to AI and its medical applications: Crash Course for an audience
  with diverse scientific backgrounds'
abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been
  developing more and more rapidly over the past few decades and teaching these methods
  can be very complicated even when students have good math and programming skills.
  Moreover, the background of the target group may be very diverse in terms of technical
  and coding skills, especially for a single introductory lecture. We describe here
  our experience in a three-hour crash course on introduction to AI and its medical
  applications, in which we alternated theoretical and practical sessions that could
  be engaging for students with different abilities and knowledge. The goals of the
  lecture were to demystify AI, introduce the challenges and current limitations of
  Deep Learning (DL), and present applications to the medical domain. The modularity
  of the course and choice of examples and tasks applied to the medical field interested
  the students who considered them authentic and relevant. The lesson has been positively
  evaluated by the students and their feedback identifies an NPS of 27 and an average
  of 8.2 over 10 when asked how likely they are to recommend the course to colleagues
  or friends.
