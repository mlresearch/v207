title: Stimulating student engagement with an AI board game tournament
abstract: Strong foundations in basic AI techniques are key to understanding more
  advanced concepts. We believe that introducing AI techniques, such as search methods,
  early in higher education helps create a deeper understanding of the concepts seen
  later in more advanced AI and algorithms courses. We present a project-based and
  competition-based bachelor course that gives second-year students an introduction
  to search methods applied to board games. In groups of two, students have to use
  network programming and AI methods to build an AI agent to compete in a board game
  tournament—othello was this year’s game. Students are evaluated based on the quality
  of their projects and on their performance during the final tournament. We believe
  that the introduction of gamification, in the form of competition-based learning,
  allows for a better learning experience for the students.
