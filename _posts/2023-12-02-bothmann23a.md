title: Developing Open Source Educational Resources for Machine Learning and Data
  Science
abstract: Education should not be a privilege but a common good. It should be openly
  accessible to everyone, with as few barriers as possible; even more so for key technologies
  such as Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science (DS). Open Educational Resources
  (OER) are a crucial factor for greater educational equity. In this paper, we describe
  the specific requirements for OER in ML and DS and argue that it is especially important
  for these fields to make source files publicly available, leading to Open Source
  Educational Resources (OSER). We present our view on the collaborative development
  of OSER, the challenges this poses, and first steps towards their solutions. We
  outline how OSER can be used for blended learning scenarios and share our experiences
  in university education. Finally, we discuss additional challenges such as credit
  assignment or granting certificates.
