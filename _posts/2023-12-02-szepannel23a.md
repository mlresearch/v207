title: Teaching Machine Learning with mlr3 using Shiny
abstract: The command-line use of R and Python can be a barrier for novice learners
  in the field of machine learning. Lowering this bar for nontechnical students may
  help them to understand important core principles of machine learning like training
  and evaluation of models. Shiny applications can provide an user friendly graphical
  interface to the machine learning workflow. mlr3shiny uses the functionalities of
  the R-package mlr3 and provides teachers and learners of machine learning the opportunity
  to explore the machine learning workflow without the need to learn R programming
  first.
