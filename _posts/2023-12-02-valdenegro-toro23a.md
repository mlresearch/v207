title: Machine Learning Students Overfit to Overfitting
abstract: Overfitting and generalization is an important concept in Machine Learning
  as only models that generalize are interesting for general applications. Yet some
  students have trouble learning this important concept through lectures and exercises.
  In this paper we describe common examples of students misunderstanding overfitting,
  and provide recommendations for possible solutions. We cover student misconceptions
  about overfitting, about solutions to overfitting, and implementation mistakes that
  are commonly confused with overfitting issues. We expect that our paper can contribute
  to improving student understanding and lectures about this important topic.
