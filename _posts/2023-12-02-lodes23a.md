title: A Deep Learning Bootcamp for Engineering & Management Students
abstract: Students from engineering & management with a focus on vocational activities
  such as machining or accounting tend to lack the necessary computer science foundations
  to build, appreciate, and evaluate machine learning solutions. However, they are
  likely going to have to identify and judge potential use cases in their careers
  in industrial practice. Therefore, we propose a guided three-day curriculum that
  goes all the way from manual data inspection to the implementation of several models
  in Python, including several evaluation metrics. We focus on a computer vision task
  identifying traffic signs due to its conceptual simplicity and similarity to tasks
  in vision-based quality assurance. In this paper, we share our material as OER as
  well as experiences weâ€™ve made throughout three offerings of the bootcamp.
